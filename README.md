1. Download the files from GitHub and opened it in your text-editor.

3. Copy and paste the desired layout from the 'Layouts' folder into the 'boilerplate-index.html' file and customize the code for your project.

### Best Practices
* Avoid using *p* tag. It give much trouble with some email clients.
* Always put *display=block* to all *img* tags, it removes small spacing below images.
* Avoid using image *height=""* tag.
* Always fill *img* *alt* attributes for accessibility reasons and it provides context for images if images are disabled.
* Always apply *font-family* to texts in the *td* tags
* Always end lists with below code. It removes added extra bullet point by email clients.
```
<div style="display:none;">&nbsp;</div>
```
* Don't use *padding* attribute to add space between 2 items. Use *td* with *width* attribute
```
<td bgcolor="91c4f2" width="20" style="font-size:0 line-height:0;padding-top:0;padding-bottom:0;">
  &nbsp;
</td>
```
